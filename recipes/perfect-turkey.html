    <h3>Dish Description</h3>

        <p>
            A perfectly seasoned and juicy turkey. My friend from France taught me to cook turkey like this, but she never measures anything so use your own judgment for vegetable amounts, etc. I usually err on the side of 'more is better'! 
        </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed </li>
            <li>2 cups kosher salt </li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter, melted </li>
            <li>2 large onions, peeled and chopped </li>
            <li>4 carrots, peeled and chopped </li>
            <li>4 stalks celery, chopped </li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme </li>
            <li>1 bay leaf </li>
            <li>1 cup dry white wine </li>
        </ul>
        
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Rub the turkey inside and out with the kosher salt. Place the bird in a large stock pot, and cover with cold water. Place in the refrigerator, and allow the turkey to soak in the salt and water mixture 12 hours, or overnight.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly rinse the turkey, and discard the brine mixture.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Brush the turkey with 1/2 the melted butter. Place breast side down on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Stuff the turkey cavity with 1 onion, 1/2 the carrots, 1/2 the celery, 1 sprig of thyme, and the bay leaf. Scatter the remaining vegetables and thyme around the bottom of the roasting pan, and cover with the white wine.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Roast uncovered 3 1/2 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, until the internal temperature of the thigh reaches 180 degrees F (85 degrees C). Carefully turn the turkey breast side up about 2/3 through the roasting time, and brush with the remaining butter. Allow the bird to stand about 30 minutes before carving.</li>
        </ol>
